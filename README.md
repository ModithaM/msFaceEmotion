# EmotionEssence 😄

**EmotionEssence** is a fun and experimental real-time facial expression recognition app built with **Next.js** and **face-api.js**. It detects your facial emotions through the webcam and maps them to expressive emojis on the screen.

⚡️ Developed in just **one day** as a demo project for the **SLIIT Silver Jubilee Exhibition**, so expect a few quirks or bugs.
